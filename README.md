This GitHub repo represents my ML projects. Dive into the code to see how I'm trying computers to get smarter with data. From data collection to training models, it's all here.

# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning playground! 
- ðŸš€ This repository hosts projects focused on predicting gold prices, car prices, and calorie burn using a variety of regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, XGBoost Regression, and more.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Gold Price Prediction

Predicting gold prices can be tricky, but our models are up for the challenge. We've employed various regression algorithms to forecast gold prices based on historical data. Check out the code, data, and results in the dedicated [Gold Price Prediction](https://github.com/RJ-Hossan/ML_Project/tree/main/Gold_Price_Predictor) directory.

### 2. Car Price Prediction

Curious about what your dream car might cost in the future? Our Car Price Prediction project has got you covered. Explore how different regression algorithms perform in estimating car prices. Head over to the [Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/RJ-Hossan/ML_Project/tree/main/Car_Price_Predictor) directory for the nitty-gritty details.

### 3. Calorie Burn Prediction

Fitness enthusiasts, this one's for you! Our Calorie Burn Prediction project utilizes regression algorithms to estimate calories burnt during physical activities. Dive into the [Calorie Burn Prediction](https://github.com/RJ-Hossan/ML_Project/tree/main/Calorie_Burnt_Predictor) directory to uncover the secrets behind the predictions.
